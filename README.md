# 🌈 Rainbow — My Creative Playground

A personal portfolio to share what I love building from design sketches to dev experiments and digital products made with heart. Built entirely with [Reflex](https://reflex.dev), styled by instinct, and crafted for curiosity.

---

## ✨ What’s inside?

- 🎨 **Design** – Illustrations, sketches
- 🧑‍💻 **Code** – Dev explorations
- 📦 **Products** – Side-projects as a founder, associate

Each section has its own visual language, and a few surprises along the way (like custom carousels or Instagram-style pop-ups).

---

## 🧠 Built with

- [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) (Python web framework)
- Python 3.13+
- Fully responsive, dark/light mode, no JS, no database — just design + logic

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luandcille/rainbow.git
